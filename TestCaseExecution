4. Clicked the "Buy" button.

Expected Result:

2. No order should be processed.

Actual Result:
1. No error message was shown, instead, a success message was shown 'Thank you for your purchase of -100 units of Gas We have popped it in the post and it will be with you shortly.
There are now 3100 units of Gas left in our stores.'
2. The negative input was allowed, and the number of units of gas were incremented by 100.
