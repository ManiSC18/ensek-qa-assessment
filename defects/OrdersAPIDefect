Defect – Order Not Reflected in `/orders` API Response

Title
Successful fuel purchase does not persist to `/orders` endpoint

Description
When a fuel purchase is made using the `PUT /buy/{id}/{quantity}` endpoint, the response confirms the purchase and returns an `orderId`. However, this order is not reflected in the response from the `GET /orders` endpoint, preventing downstream verification.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Call `PUT /buy/1/2980` (or similar) to purchase fuel.
2. Note the `orderId` in the success response:
{
    "message": "You have purchased 2995 m³ at a cost of 1.7000000000000002 there are 5 units remaining. Your order id is 891ddaf2-6d46-4ad8-9079-2c2bb99607b9."
}
3. Call `GET /orders`
4. Observe that the returned list does not contain an order with this ID or matching details.

Expected Result
The new order should be included in the `/orders` list, containing the matching `id`, `fuel`, and `quantity`.

Actual Result
The new order is not present in the `/orders` list, despite a successful response from the purchase request.

Impact
- Prevents automated or manual validation of the purchase.
- Affects the reliability of the order-tracking functionality.
- Breaks API contract expectations between `PUT /buy` and `GET /orders`.

Severity
Medium – Affects critical end-to-end test path and API trustworthiness.
